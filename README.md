# Zak.Discord.Bot
Just a simple Discord bot made in Python using the discord.py library, https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

My initial idea was to create a small personal bot for my Discord server, but it's sort of turned into a bigger side project of mine.


This is my first Github repository / project, so expect it to be messy. Next time I promise to learn Github.
